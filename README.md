# Sudoku
This project is a work in progress. The project was started because I was pretty into Sudoku and it seemed like a good project to try and code. I didn't realise the battle it would put up when trying to figure it out, but it's been a fun process so far!
My goal is to not only make a sudoku board with different difficulties, but also allow for people to play the game. It's currently setup to just create the final board. I'm currently getting it to get the numbers in their correct spots. Difficulty will be measured by the number of spots that are revealed.
