# Sudoku
This project is a work in progress. The project was started because I love playing Sudoku and it seemed like a good project to try and code. I didn't know how much it would challenge me.
My goal is to not only make a sudoku board with different difficulties, but also allow for people to play the game. It's currently setup to just create the final board. I'm currently getting it to get the numbers in their correct spots. Difficulty will be measured by the number of spots that are revealed.
